Flag icons
==========

There is a built in function to output flags for use in localeswitchers or
other places. It is called with `{{ flag_icon(key) }}` where key is a country
code (like `gb` or `de`). The flags are then embedded in an SVG format. A list
of available flags can be seen [here][flags].
